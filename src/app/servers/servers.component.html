<!-- property binding using Square brackets [] which tells Angular that we want to dynamically bind some property and disable the HTML attribute.
    but here we're not using the disabled attribute anymore, with the square brackets, we are directly binding
to this native disabled property
 -->
 <!-- this whole syntax here [disabled]="!allowNewServer" is a syntax recognized by Angular,
so this is why between the quotation marks, you can already and you have already, you have to write TypeScript
code because again, this whole expression is evaluated by Angular, mixing in string interpolation will
break it,

 <!-- 
    listening to the input event (input)
    (input)="onUpdateServerName($event)" this will update the server name on keystrokes, the $ sign reserved word which gives us access to event data. Thus passing as $event is to retrieve the data and be able to use that in our method
