<!-- property binding using Square brackets [] which tells Angular that we want to dynamically bind some property and disable the HTML attribute.
    but here we're not using the disabled attribute anymore, with the square brackets, we are directly binding
to this native disabled property
 -->
 <!-- this whole syntax here [disabled]="!allowNewServer" is a syntax recognized by Angular,

so this is why between the quotation marks, you can already and you have already, you have to write TypeScript

code because again, this whole expression is evaluated by Angular, mixing in string interpolation will

break it, 
Traditionally, we could use onclick event that the element offers us, however Angular offers Event Binding.
creating an Event with (name of event)
-->
<button class="btn btn-primary"
    [disabled]="!allowNewServer"
    (click)="onCreateServer()">
    Add Server
</button>
<!-- <p [innerText]="allowNewServer"></p> -->
<p>
    {{serverCreationStatus}}
</p>
<app-server></app-server>
